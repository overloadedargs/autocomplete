For development purposes and testing because of CORS issues, you can use a local proxy, 

```npm install --save-dev local-cors-proxy```
```lcp --proxyUrl http://api.edamam.com/```

## Using TailwindCSS

By default tailwind will build main.css from the known tailwind css in templates, check tailwind.config.js

```npx tailwindcss -i app/assets/css/src/main.css -o app/assets/css/main.css --watch```

Hanami also needs to compile assets into public/assets, check assets/js/app.js for includes.

```hanami assets compile```

## Compiling es6

In the older version of this app, there was two steps to compile the js, the new Hanami version only
requires us to add files into app/assets/js, but this may still be useful for debugging.

`npx babel app/assets/js/src/* --out-dir app/assets/js/`

`npx browserify app/assets/js/src/* -o app/assets/js/application.js -t [ babelify --presets [ @babel/preset-env ] --plugins [ babel-plugin-transform-class-properties ] ]`

## Setup

How to run tests:

```
% bundle exec rake
```

or 

```
% bundle exec rspec
```


How to run the development console:

```
% bundle exec hanami console
```

How to run the development server:

```
% bundle exec hanami server
```

How to prepare (create and migrate) DB for `development` and `test` environments:

```
% bundle exec hanami db prepare

% HANAMI_ENV=test bundle exec hanami db prepare
```
